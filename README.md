I'm Pranjal Srivastava, a passionate self taught developer and content creator. I have authored 77+ courses with over 200,000+ students worldwide across 189 countries on wide array of technologies like containerization, cloud computing, microservices, machine learning, devops, linux, database and programming language.

Coding is my passion, and over the years I have used a wide range of programming and scripting languages including Python, Java, C, and others. During my college years, I have developed a New Programming Language in HINDI, that allows people to write code in Devanagari Script and build logic in their mother tongue.
